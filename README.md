# Albero

This is an island filled with all the trees you could imagine. People? No. Trees? Yes.
At island Albero (italian for tree), you can hang in trees, hug trees, talk with trees, eat some pie beside a tree. You get the picture.

# Treehotel

In this hotel our guests gets to explore the tree-tops, from their room. We provide the finest (and some not that fine) treehouses in the world, high up in the trees.
